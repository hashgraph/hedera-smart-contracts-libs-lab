# Support

If you need help using the product, there are a number of resources available.

## Documentation

The [Hedera Documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/guides) is the primary resource for learning about Hedera Hashgraph
products. It contains core concepts, getting started guides, and individual product documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

The [Hedera Help](https://help.hedera.com) site contains answers to the most frequently ask questions about Hedera Hashgraph.

## GitHub Repository

A lot of times, individual product source repositories can contain more detailed or technical documentation that may
be useful. Browse the list of Hedera Hashgraph source code repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/hashgraph) and
look for a `docs` folder that contains markdown documents. For example, the Hedera Mirror Node
[docs](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/tree/main/docs) folder contains design documents, installation,
and operational guides that are useful if you're intending to run your own mirror node.

## Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:

- [Discord](https://www.hedera.com/discord)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)

Before opening a new discussion item or issue, it's helpful to search the project. It's likely that another user has
already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of. It is also worth asking on
Discord.

### Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com) is a popular instant messaging platform designed for creating communities. Hedera
developers and other community members regularly hang out there and are more than happy to answer any questions.

### GitHub Discussions

[GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) is the primary way to ask questions and receive support.
Discussions should be preferred as instant messaging applications don't provide an easy way to search past questions to
see if it's already been answered. Asking in Discussions can help provide a database of frequently asked questions (FAQ),
reducing the support burden and helping newcomers. Depending on how the discussion proceeds, these can later turn into
a bug or feature request.
